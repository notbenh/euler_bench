# If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,
# then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
#
# If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in
# words, how many letters would be used?
#
# Notes say something about "and" in numbers, but I have ignored this as I
# have no idea how to count this.
#
# Obvious optimizations: Just store the number of letters in each word rather
# than the actual string.  That's harder to test, but would be vastly more
# efficient.
