Introduction

  To allow compiled lanuages to be run, we have a two pass compile
  and run. The first pass takes a configurable script name, exec's
  that script passing the current file. The script will then
  output another command to be run. It's this command that is
  acutally timed.

  All this is done in a jail, which is deleted after each run. No
  additional cleanup is necessary.

Configuration
  name of script to executed foreach file

Variables
  in: name of the file (or directory) currently being evaluated

Return
  out: command (with args) to be exec'd
