# Problem 44
# 23 May 2003
#
# Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n-1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
#
# 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
#
# It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.
#
# Find the smallest pair of pentagonal numbers for which their sum and difference is pentagonal; what is their difference?
