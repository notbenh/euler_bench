Euler Benchmark Suite

The Euler Benchmark Suite aims at comparing language speeds for the Euler
Project Problems at http://projecteuler.net/.

This currently consists of Perl 5, Rakudo Perl 6 and Parrot solutions, but all languages are
welcome.

= Installation
==================

In order for the included comparison scripts to work, you need to
ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed.

cd into the git checkout

run 'perl Makefile.PL'.
  You will want to answer 'yes' to installing dependencies if you want
  the included comparison scripts to work.

run 'make installdeps'
  This should use CPANPLUS or CPAN to install the necessary
  prerequisite modules for running the comparison scripts.


= File Naming
==================

Files in each directory are named according to:

<language>/<3-digit project euler number>/<2-digit implementation number>.ext
